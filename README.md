# Orbital elements in Rust

It's a project for my celestial mechanics class in fall 2022.
I decided to upload it here for storage/future use.

## By far:
What it does right now is prints Sun's rectangular geocentric coordinates for 3 dates of observation (for now they are set, working on I/O).

## Compilation

I recommend using *cargo* manager:
```
git clone https://github.com/pliniewicz/orbital_elements.git .
cd orbital_elements
cargo build
```
